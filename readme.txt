** THIS PROJECT IS ABANDONED **

Jease eases the development of content- & database-driven web-applications with Java.

Out of the box Jease provides an Ajax-powered Content-Management-System (CMS) which makes use of drag & drop to organize content.

Please visit the Jease-Website for more information:

Jease is built on top of the most advanced open-source technologies existing in the Java-community:

db4o or Perst as object-oriented persistence engines.
Lucene as high performance indexing and search technology.
ZK as component- & event-driven Ajax-Web-Framework.

Jease glues these technologies together to provide an outstanding productive development expierence by combining the safety and ide-/compiler-support of Java with the turn-around-times of scripting languages.
